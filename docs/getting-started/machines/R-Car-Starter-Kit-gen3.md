## BSP Version of R-Car Starter Kit Gen3

* AGL master: 3.7
* AGL eel 5.0.3: 2.23.1

## Building the AGL Demo Platform for R-Car Starter Kit Gen3

Before setting up the build environment, you need to download the proprietary drivers.

* Download Renesas graphics drivers with a "click through" license from [Renesas website][rcar Linux Drivers 2]
  * If you are building **AGL Daring Dab or older release** download Renesas graphics drivers with a "click through" license from [here][rcar Linux Drivers].
  * Under the Target hardware: **R-Car H3/M3** section.

* The version of the driver can be found here:

```bash
grep -rn ZIP_.= meta-agl/meta-agl-bsp/meta-rcar-gen3/scripts/setup_mm_packages.sh
```

**Note**:

* You have to register with a free account on MyRenesas and accept the license conditions before downloading the drivers.
 The operation is fast and simple nevertheless mandatory to access evaluation of non open-source drivers for free.
 Once you registered, you can download two zip files.
* The files must be stored into your download directory (usually $HOME/Downloads, pointed by $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR).

Here after is an example of the typical files downloaded at the time of writing:

```bash
test -f ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/user-dirs.dirs && source ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/user-dirs.dirs
chmod a+r $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR/*.zip
ls -1 $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR
-rw-r--r--. 1 1664 agl-sdk 4.5M Dec  8 15:23 R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-weston2-20170904.zip
-rw-r--r--. 1 1664 agl-sdk 3,0M Dec  8 15:24 R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-weston2-20170904.zip
```

### Setting up the build environment

Define the type of R-Car Starter Kit board as a variable:

* for machine **h3ulcb** (Starter Kit Premier/H3) :

```bash
export MACHINE=h3ulcb
```

* for machine **m3ulcb** (Starter Kit Pro/M3):

```bash
export MACHINE=m3ulcb
```

* for machine **h3-salvator-x**:

```bash
export MACHINE=h3-salvator-x
```

Now, init your build environment:

```bash
cd $AGL_TOP
source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m $MACHINE -b build agl-devel agl-demo agl-netboot agl-appfw-smack agl-localdev
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Read the log to be sure you had no error during your setup.

In case of missing graphics drivers, you could notice an error message as follow:

```bash
[snip]
--- fragment /home/working/workspace_agl_master/meta-agl/templates/machine/h3ulcb/50_setup.sh
/home/working/workspace_agl_master /home/working/workspace_agl_master/build_gen3
The graphics and multimedia acceleration packages for
the R-Car Gen3 board can be downloaded from:
 https://www.renesas.com/en-us/solutions/automotive/rcar-demoboard-2.html

These 2 files from there should be store in your'/home/devel/Downloads' directory.
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-weston2-20170904.zip
  R-Car_Gen3_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-weston2-20170904.zip
/home/working/workspace_agl_master/build_gen3
--- fragment /home/working/workspace_agl_master/meta-agl/templates/base/99_setup_EULAconf.sh
--- end of setup script
OK
Generating setup file: /home/working/workspace_agl_master/build_gen3/agl-init-build-env ... OK
------------ aglsetup.sh: Done
[snip]
```

If you encounter this issue, or any other unwanted behavior, you can fix the error mentioned and then clean up by removing the “$AGL_TOP/build” directory then re-launch the procedure again.

After this command, the working directory is changed to $AGL_TOP/build.

Users may want to check that the board is correctly selected in the environment:

```bash
grep -w -e "^MACHINE =" $AGL_TOP/build/conf/local.conf
  MACHINE = "h3ulcb"
or
  MACHINE = "m3ulcb"
or
  MACHINE = "h3-salvator-x"
```

Configure for Release or Development:

* development images contain extra tools for developer convenience, in particular:
  * a debugger (gdb)
  * some tweaks, including a disabled root password
  * a SFTP server
  * the TCF Agent for easier application deployment and remote debugging
  * some extra system tools (usb, bluetooth ...)
  * ...

We explicitely activate these debug facilities by specifying the “agl-devel agl-netboot” feature.

### Build your image

The process to build an image is simple:

```bash
bitbake agl-demo-platform
```
You may need to install rpcgen to run this command.

When finished (it may take few hours), you should get the final result:

```bash
ls -l $AGL_TOP/build/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE
```

**Note**:

In case of failure of the build it is safe to first check that the Linux distribution chosen for your host has been validated for the current version of Yocto used by AGL.

## Booting AGL Image on R-Car Starter Kit Gen3 boards using a microSD card

To boot the board using a micro-SD card, there are two operations that must be done prior to first initial boot:

* Update all firmware on the device.
* Set up the board to boot on the SD-card.

For each subsequent build you only need to rewrite the SD-card with the new image.

### Firmware Update

This proceedure is done in two steps.  The first step only needs to be done once per device.  The second step should be done, starting with the Eel release, per release.

#### Update Sample Loader and MiniMonitor

Follow the documentation on the [eLinux.org wiki][R-car loader update] for the exact list of steps on how to perform the required steps to update to at least version 3.02.  This should be done even in the case where a **Kingfisher** or other expansion board will not be connected.

#### Update the firmware stack

As an AArch64 platform, both the **h3ulcb** and **m3ulcb** have a firmware stack that consists of multiple parts.

In both cases we have **ARM Trusted Firmware**, **OP-Tee** and **U-Boot** in use.

Starting with Eel you must update the firmware to at least the version referenced here.  For the exact steps required to flash the device see the eLinux.org wiki for **[h3ulcb][R-car h3ulcb firmware update]** or **[m3ulcb][R-car m3ulcb firmware update]** respectively.

In both cases the files listed in the table will be found in the directory:

```bash
*\$AGL_TOP/build/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE*
```

The Salvator-X firmware update process is not documented on eLinux.

### Prepare the SD-card on the host

Plug the microSD card and get its associated device by either running *`dmesg | tail -15`* or *`lsblk`*, for example:

```bash
dmesg | tail -15

  [ 1971.462160] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00
  [ 1971.462277] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] No Caching mode page found
  [ 1971.462278] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdc] Assuming drive cache: write through
  [ 1971.463870]  sdc: sdc1 sdc2
```

Here, the SD-card is attached to the device /dev/sdc.

```bash
lsblk

  NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda      8:0    0 167,7G  0 disk
  ├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/efi
  ├─sda2   8:2    0 159,3G  0 part /
  └─sda3   8:3    0   7,9G  0 part [SWAP]
  sdb      8:16   0 931,5G  0 disk
  └─sdb1   8:17   0 931,5G  0 part /media/storage
  sdc      8:32   1  14,9G  0 disk
  ├─sdc1   8:33   1    40M  0 part
  └─sdc2   8:34   1   788M  0 part
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is a critical operation, each computer is different and removable devices can change from time to time:
so you should repeat this operation each time you insert the microSD card to confirm the device name.

In the example above, we see:

* the first SATA drive as 'sda'.
* 'sdc' corresponds to the microSD card, and is also marked as removable device by *lsblk* which is a good confirmation.
* Your desktop system probably offers a choice to mount the SD-card automatically in some directory.
* In the next sample code, we'll suppose that the SD-card mount directory is stored in the variable $SDCARD.
* For example, if the microSD card is associated with device *sdc*:

Go to your build directory:

```bash
cd $AGL_TOP/build/tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE
```

You can use bmaptool to copy the **.wic.xz** file to the storage device, discovered in the previous step:

```bash
bmaptool copy ./agl-demo-platform-$MACHINE.wic.xz /dev/sdc
```

Or you can be uncompressed and written to the device:

```bash
  sudo umount /dev/sdc
  xzcat ./agl-demo-platform-$MACHINE.wic.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdc bs=4M
  sync
```

### Booting the board

* Turn the board off using the power switch.
* Insert the microSD-card.
* Verify that you have plugged in, at least, the following:
  * External monitor on HDMI port
  * Input device (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen...) on USB port.

* Turn the board on using the power switch.
 After a few seconds, you'll see the AGL splash screen on the display and you'll be able to log in on the console terminal or in the graphic screen.

## Serial Console Setup

### Install a serial client on your computer

This can be “screen”, “picocom”, “minicom”.
The lighter of the 3 is “picocom” (it has less dependencies).

### Plug a USB cable from your computer to the serial CP2102 USB port (micro USB-A)

With “dmesg” you can check the device created for the serial link.
Usually, it's /dev/ttyUSB0 but the number may vary depending on other USB serial ports connected to the host.
To get it, you must switch the board on.
For example:

```bash
dmesg | tail
[2097783.287091] usb 2-1.5.3: new full-speed USB device number 24 using ehci-pci
[2097783.385857] usb 2-1.5.3: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6001
[2097783.385862] usb 2-1.5.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[2097783.385864] usb 2-1.5.3: Product: FT232R USB UART
[2097783.385866] usb 2-1.5.3: Manufacturer: FTDI
[2097783.385867] usb 2-1.5.3: SerialNumber: AK04WWCE
[2097783.388288] ftdi_sio 2-1.5.3:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
[2097783.388330] usb 2-1.5.3: Detected FT232RL
[2097783.388658] usb 2-1.5.3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

The link is attached to the device /dev/ttyUSB0.
It is time to launch your serial client.
Example:

```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

or

```bash
minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

or

```bash
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

### Configure U-boot parameters

Follow the steps below to configure the boot from microSD card and to set screen resolution:

* Turn the board on using the power switch.
* Hit any key to stop autoboot (warning you have only few seconds).
* Type **print** to check if you have correct parameters for booting your board:
  * For machine h3ulcb:

    ```bash
=> printenv
    baudrate=115200
    bootargs=console=ttySC0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rootwait ro rootfstype=ext4
    bootcmd=run load_ker; run load_dtb; booti 0x48080000 - 0x48000000
    bootdelay=3
    fdt_high=0xffffffffffffffff
    initrd_high=0xffffffffffffffff

    Environment size: 648/131068 bytes
    ```

    * For machine m3ulcb:

    ```bash
=> printenv
    baudrate=115200
    bootargs=console=ttySC0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rootwait ro rootfstype=ext4

    ver=U-Boot 2015.04 (Nov 30 2016 - 18:25:18)

    Environment size: 557/131068 bytes
    ```

    * If not, copy line by line:

    ```bash
setenv bootargs console=ttySC0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rootwait ro rootfstype=ext4
setenv bootcmd run load_ker\; run load_dtb\; booti 0x48080000 - 0x48000000
setenv load_ker ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48080000 /boot/Image
    ```

    * For machine h3ulcb (BSP >= 2.19):

    ```bash
setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/Image-r8a7795-es1-h3ulcb.dtb
    ```

    * For machine h3ulcb (BSP < 2.19):

    ```bash
setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/Image-r8a7795-h3ulcb.dtb
    ```

    * For machine m3ulcb:

    ```bash
setenv load_dtb ext4load mmc 0:1 0x48000000 /boot/Image-r8a7796-m3ulcb.dtb
    ```

    * Finally save boot environment:

    ```bash
saveenv
    ```

* Now you can boot:

```bash
run bootcmd
```

### Console boot

After booting, you should see the wayland display on the external monitor and a login prompt on the console, such as:

* For machine h3ulcb:

```bash
Automotive Grade Linux ${AGL_VERSION} h3ulcb ttySC0

h3ulcb login: root
```

* For machine m3ulcb:

```bash
Automotive Grade Linux ${AGL_VERSION} m3ulcb ttySC0

m3ulcb login: root
```

Logging in on the console is easy:

* login is 'root'
* password is empty (not asked)

### Network access

If the board is connected to a local network using ethernet and if a DHCP server is able to distribute IP addresses,
you can then determine the Gen3 board IP address and log in using ssh:

```bash
m3ulcb login: root
Last login: Tue Dec  6 09:55:15 UTC 2016 on tty2
root@m3ulcb:~# ip -4 a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 10.0.0.27/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
root@m3ulcb:~#
```

Here, IP address is 10.0.0.27. Logging in using SSH is easy:

```bash
$ ssh root@10.0.0.27
Last login: Tue Dec  6 10:01:11 2016 from 10.0.0.13
root@m3ulcb:~# cat /etc/os-release
